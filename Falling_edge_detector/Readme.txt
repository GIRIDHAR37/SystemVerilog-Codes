Deep Dive into Falling Edge Detectors (Negedge Detectors)
A falling edge detector (also known as a negedge detector) is a digital circuit that detects when a signal transitions from a high state (1) to a low state (0). This type of circuit is commonly used in various timing-sensitive applications, where it is essential to monitor specific signal transitions.

How Falling Edge Detectors Work:
A falling edge detector continuously monitors a signal and detects the exact moment it transitions from 1 to 0. This detection is typically done using a combination of clocking logic and previous-state tracking. Here's how it works:

Clock Synchronization: The signal is sampled on the rising edge of a clock (posedge clk) to ensure synchronization in synchronous designs.
State Memory: The previous value of the signal is stored. By comparing the current value with the previous one, the detector identifies the edge.
Detection Condition: If the signal changes from 1 (previous state) to 0 (current state), a falling edge is detected.
Explanation of the Design:
The falling edge detector module has the following key components:

Inputs:

Clock (clk): The clock signal is used to synchronize the detection process.
Signal (signal): The signal that is monitored for falling edges.
Output:

Edge Detected (ed): A flag output that indicates whether a falling edge was detected in the signal.
Working:

On every positive edge of the clock (posedge clk), the current value of the signal is compared with its previous value (signalPrev).
If the current signal is 0 and the previous signal was 1, this implies a falling edge, and the output ed is asserted.
The previous value of the signal is updated after every clock cycle for comparison in the next cycle.
This simple design ensures that the edge detection happens in a synchronized manner, avoiding glitches due to signal transitions happening between clock cycles.

Testbench Explanation:
In the testbench, the following is done to verify the functionality of the falling edge detector:

Clock Generation: A clock signal (clk) is generated with a period of 10ns (100MHz).
Test Stimulus: The signal input is driven with different values to simulate various scenarios:
No edge: The signal stays low, so no falling edge should be detected.
Rising then Falling Edge: The signal goes high and then transitions low, creating a falling edge.
Multiple Falling Edges: The signal transitions multiple times, with multiple falling edges.
Constant High Signal: The signal stays high, so no falling edge should be detected.
Monitoring: The values of the clk, signal, and ed (edge detected output) are printed for easy debugging.
Simulation Control: The simulation runs for a certain time and is terminated when the test cases are completed.
Pros of Falling Edge Detectors:
Precise Timing Detection: Falling edge detectors are essential for accurately detecting signal transitions, especially in timing-sensitive applications such as communication protocols.
Simplicity: The design is relatively simple and can be implemented efficiently in hardware.
Glitch Detection: By synchronizing with a clock, falling edge detectors can help filter out signal glitches that are shorter than the clock period.
Cons of Falling Edge Detectors:
Clock Dependency: The detector is dependent on the clock signal, so if the signal transition occurs between clock cycles, the detection may be delayed until the next clock edge.
Edge Detection Limited to One Type: The design is limited to detecting only falling edges. Separate logic is needed for rising edges or to detect both edges simultaneously.
Potential Latency: There may be a slight delay in edge detection depending on the clock frequency.
Applications of Falling Edge Detectors:
Debouncing in Switches: Falling edge detectors are often used in debouncing circuits for mechanical switches where a reliable transition is needed without interpreting noise as multiple transitions.
Pulse Detection: Detecting the end of a pulse or signal, such as in timing circuits where the end of an active-high signal needs to trigger an event.
Communication Protocols: Many communication protocols (e.g., SPI, I2C) use edge detection to trigger data sampling or other operations, as falling edges often signal the completion of a data transmission.
Event Triggering: In control systems, falling edges can trigger events like interrupt requests, resets, or the initiation of state transitions.
Tools Used for Code Execution:
Questasim: The testbench and design are simulated using Questasim, a simulation tool widely used in the semiconductor industry. It allows users to verify the design by observing the signal transitions, waveforms, and output values during different test cases. Questasim supports the SystemVerilog language used for both the design and testbench code.
Gvim Text Editor: The code for the design and testbench is written and debugged using Gvim, a powerful text editor that supports syntax highlighting and other features useful for hardware description languages like SystemVerilog.
Conclusion:
Falling edge detectors are fundamental components in digital systems that require accurate signal monitoring. Their ability to detect transitions from high to low makes them suitable for numerous applications, particularly in control and communication systems. By implementing and simulating these detectors in tools like Questasim and using Gvim for code development, designers can ensure proper functionality in their hardware designs.
