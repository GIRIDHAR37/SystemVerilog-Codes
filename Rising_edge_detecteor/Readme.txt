What is a Posedge Detector?
A posedge (rising edge) detector is a digital circuit used to identify when an input signal transitions from a low state (0) to a high state (1). This is crucial in synchronous digital systems where various events or data transfers occur based on specific signal transitions. The detection typically happens on a clock’s rising edge, ensuring that any input signal is sampled at precise time intervals and eliminating any glitches.

How It Works
The core idea behind a posedge detector is to compare the current state of the input signal to its previous state. If the current signal is 1 and the previous signal was 0, a rising edge has occurred. To implement this:

Store the previous state of the signal.
On each clock cycle, compare the current signal to the stored state.
If a 0 → 1 transition is detected, the detector outputs a high signal (1) for one clock cycle, indicating a rising edge.
Pros of Posedge Detectors:
Precise Timing: Since the detector operates on clock edges, it offers synchronized detection in systems where precise timing is critical.
Simplicity: The logic required to implement a posedge detector is simple and minimal (just a few flip-flops and combinational logic).
Reliability: Since the rising edge detector only activates during a clear 0 → 1 transition, it can ignore transient glitches or noise on the input signal, improving reliability.
Wide Applications: Posedge detectors can be used in various applications, such as interrupt signals, data latches, and clocked control signals in FSMs (Finite State Machines).
Cons of Posedge Detectors:
Latency: There is always a 1-clock-cycle latency in detecting an edge, which may not be suitable for high-speed or real-time applications.
Limited to Synchronous Systems: The detector works best in clocked (synchronous) environments. It can fail to detect transitions in asynchronous systems unless additional design is incorporated.
Single Edge Sensitivity: Posedge detectors only identify rising edges. If you need to detect both rising and falling edges, additional logic or design complexity is required.
Applications of Posedge Detectors:
Interrupt Handling: In microcontrollers or processors, rising edge detectors are used to detect hardware interrupts, ensuring that only a single event is triggered when a signal rises.
Data Sampling: In communication systems, posedge detectors can sample incoming data signals when they transition from low to high.
Event Counters: They are often used in systems where events (like button presses) are counted only when a rising edge occurs.
Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) Generators: In PWM circuits, rising edge detection can be used to measure the pulse width of input signals.
Design Explanation
Design Overview
The RisingEdgeDetector Verilog design monitors an input signal (signal) and detects when it transitions from 0 to 1, outputting a high signal (edge) during the next clock cycle. Here’s how the design functions without the code:

Inputs and Outputs: The design has a clock input (clk), an input signal (signal), and an output (edge) to indicate when a rising edge is detected.

State Storage: It maintains an internal register (signalPrev) to store the previous value of the input signal. This stored value is used to compare with the current signal on each clock cycle.

Edge Detection Logic: On each clock cycle, the current and previous signal values are compared. If the current value is 1 and the previous value was 0, this indicates a rising edge, and the output (edge) is set to 1. Otherwise, the output remains 0.

Testbench Overview
The testbench is used to verify that the RisingEdgeDetector behaves as expected:

Clock Generation: A clock signal is generated using an always block, toggling the clock every 5 ns to simulate a 100 MHz clock.

Stimulus Application: The signal is changed at specific intervals to create rising and falling edges. The goal is to test whether the RisingEdgeDetector correctly identifies the rising edges (0 → 1 transitions).

Result Monitoring: The testbench includes a monitor that prints the values of clk, signal, and edge during the simulation to track the behavior of the module.

The testbench is essential for verifying the detector's operation, and simulation tools such as Questasim help visualize the waveform and verify the correctness of the output.

Tools Used
Execution: The Verilog design and testbench were executed using Siemens Questasim. Questasim is a leading simulation tool for digital design, allowing comprehensive verification of both simple and complex designs, and supporting SystemVerilog/UVM for testbenches.

Editing & Debugging: The Verilog code was written and debugged using the Gvim text editor. Gvim is a versatile text editor that offers extensive functionality for programming and debugging code, supporting features like syntax highlighting and error tracking.
