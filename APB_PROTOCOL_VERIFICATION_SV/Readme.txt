Description of APB Protocol Version 3

1. APB3 Protocol Overview
The Advanced Peripheral Bus (APB) Version 3, part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) family, is designed for low-bandwidth, low-power communication between the processor and peripherals. It offers a simple, efficient interface for slower peripherals like UARTs, GPIOs, and other control registers.

2. Key Features of APB3
Signal Set:

PCLK: Peripheral clock.
PRESETn: Active low reset.
PSEL: Peripheral select signal.
PENABLE: Indicates the access phase.
PWRITE: Specifies write operation when high.
PWDATA: Data bus for write operations.
PRDATA: Data bus for read operations.
PREADY: Signals when the transfer is ready.
PSLVERR: Indicates an error condition.
Enhanced Functionality:

Wait States: Controlled using PREADY for slower peripherals.
Error Signaling: PSLVERR provides error status for failed transfers.
Pipeline Optimization: Setup and access phases ensure efficient use of clock cycles.
3. Design Implementation in Verilog
The Verilog implementation of APB3 follows an FSM-based architecture to handle different phases of operation:

IDLE: Waits for a valid PSEL and PENABLE.
SETUP: Prepares for data transfer.
ACCESS: Executes read/write operation.
TRANSFER: Completes the transaction and resets the state.
Key Functionalities:

Read/Write Memory:
Write: Data is written to memory when PWRITE is high.
Read: Data is read from memory when PWRITE is low.
Error Detection:
Invalid addresses trigger PSLVERR.
Overflow and underflow conditions are managed via counters.
4. SystemVerilog Testbench Description

APB Invalid Address Functional Coverage Description :

Based on the screenshot of the QuestaSim functional coverage analysis for an APB testbench, here is a detailed breakdown of the APB Invalid Address functional coverage:

Functional Coverage Overview
The APB Invalid Address test focuses on evaluating how the system responds to transactions with addresses that fall outside valid ranges or violate address alignment rules. This is crucial to ensure robust error handling and reliable behavior in unexpected scenarios.

Overall Coverage: 77.08%
This result indicates that the testbench has exercised a majority of the invalid address scenarios but left some specific bins unexplored.

Covergroups and Coverpoints Analysis
PADDR_I (50% Coverage):

Tests various address ranges, but only 50% of bins were hit, leaving significant gaps.
The gaps likely correspond to invalid or edge-case addresses that were not fully stimulated in the test.
PWDATA_I (33.33% Coverage):

Write data path coverage is incomplete, with bins auto[85:169] and auto[170:255] remaining unhit.
This indicates limited testing of data values during invalid address accesses.

Read data path coverage mirrors the write data path results, with similar unexplored bins.
This could imply missed testing of read responses during invalid address scenarios.
PSLVERR_O (100% Coverage):

Coverage Gaps:
Address Space (PADDR_I):

Only 50% coverage, leaving significant gaps in address space validation.
Uncovered bins likely represent specific invalid addresses or regions not yet tested.
Data Paths (PWDATA_I and PRDATA_O):
