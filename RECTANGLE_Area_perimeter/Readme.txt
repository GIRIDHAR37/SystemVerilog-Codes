This SystemVerilog code defines a class rectangle and a testbench module tb. Here's a breakdown of the code:

Class: rectangle
The class has two properties:

length: a random integer representing the length of the rectangle.
width: a random integer representing the width of the rectangle.
Constraints: A constraint block len_wid_c is defined to ensure:

length is between 0 and 50.
width is between 50 and 100.
Methods:

display(): This function prints the values of length and width.
area(): This function calculates and returns the area of the rectangle using the formula: length * width.
perimeter(): This function calculates and returns the perimeter using the formula: 2 * (length + width).
Testbench: tb
A handle rec for the rectangle class is created.
Inside an initial block:
The object rec is instantiated using rec = new().
The randomize() method is used to generate random values for length and width (within the defined constraints).
The display() method is called to print the values of length and width.
The area and perimeter of the rectangle are calculated using area() and perimeter(), and the results are displayed.
Expected Output:
The code provides a sample output:

verilog
Copy code
# length : 8 , width : 52
# area of rectangle : 416 
# perimeter of rectangle : 120
Tools Used:
Siemens QuestaSim 2023.0.3 (Simulation)

QuestaSim is a popular simulation tool used in the semiconductor industry for verifying designs written in HDL (Hardware Description Languages) like Verilog, SystemVerilog, and VHDL.
In this case, the simulation environment helps to run the testbench tb and observe the random values of length and width, as well as the calculated area and perimeter.
Gvim (Text Editor)

Gvim is a graphical version of the Vim text editor. It is widely used for editing code and supports syntax highlighting for languages like SystemVerilog.
Giridhar uses Gvim to write and edit SystemVerilog code before running simulations in QuestaSim.
Steps to Simulate the Code:
Open QuestaSim:

Launch QuestaSim (version 2023.0.3) and load the project.
Load the rec.sv File:

Use the vlog command to compile the SystemVerilog file.
bash
Copy code
vlog rec.sv
Simulate the Testbench:

Use the vsim command to simulate the tb module:
bash
Copy code
vsim tb
Run the simulation with:
bash
Copy code
run -all
Observe Output:

The results will be displayed in the QuestaSim console, showing the random length and width values, and the calculated area and perimeter.

This code demonstrates basic SystemVerilog OOP concepts like classes, randomization, and constraints, which are useful in testbench development for verification.
