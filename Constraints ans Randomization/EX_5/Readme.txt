Detailed Description of Code Implementation:
The problem statement requires generating and printing an array of elements in the format 7, 77, 777, 7777,... up to 15 elements. The approach uses a class-based SystemVerilog model, employing randomization and constraints to achieve the desired pattern.

Breakdown of the Code:
Class Definition (sample):

A class named sample is defined to encapsulate the array and the logic for generating its values.
Inside the class, a dynamic array of longint type (longintA[]) is declared to hold the numbers following the specific pattern.
Randomization and Constraints:

A constraint block longintA_c is provided to control the array's content during randomization:
Array Size Constraint: The array longintA is constrained to have a size of 15.
Pattern Generation:
The first element is set to 7.
For each subsequent element (starting from index 1), the current element is calculated as (previous element * 10) + 7. This logic creates the pattern 7, 77, 777, 7777, ....
Printing the Array:

A print() function is defined inside the class, which uses $display to print the array's contents in a formatted manner. The use of %p ensures that the array is printed as a list.
Module (top) and Simulation:

A SystemVerilog module named top is created to run the simulation.
An instance of the sample class is created in the initial block.
The randomize() method of the class is invoked to apply the constraints and fill the array according to the specified pattern.
The print() function is called to display the generated array on the console.
Tools Used:
Siemens Questasim 2023.0.3 for Code Execution:

The code was executed using Siemens Questasim 2023.0.3, which is a powerful simulation tool for verifying SystemVerilog designs.
Questasim handled the randomization, array generation, and printed the output to the simulation console.
Gvim Text Editor for Code Editing:

The code was written and edited using Gvim, a highly customizable text editor known for its efficiency and simplicity when editing code files.
Gvim provided syntax highlighting and other useful features while writing the SystemVerilog code, ensuring a smooth development experience.
